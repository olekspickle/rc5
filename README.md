# RC5 algorithm implementation

### [*from wiki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC5):
In cryptography, RC5 is a symmetric-key block cipher notable for its simplicity. 
Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994, RC stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, 
"Ron's Code" (compare RC2 and RC4). 
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) candidate RC6 was based on RC5.
